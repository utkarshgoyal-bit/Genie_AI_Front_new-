[Use same header as Template #1]

**Dear Google Play Review Team,**

I am appealing the suspension regarding app permissions usage and providing clear justification for each permission.

### Permissions Requested and Justification

**1. CAMERA Permission**

- **Why needed:** Users take photos of their plants for AI diagnosis
- **Core functionality:** Essential for primary app feature
- **User benefit:** Enables real-time plant photo capture
- **Runtime request:** Yes, only requested when user taps camera button
- **Graceful degradation:** Users can still select photos from gallery if denied

**2. READ_MEDIA_IMAGES / READ_MEDIA_VIDEO (Android 13+)**

- **Why needed:** Users select existing plant photos from gallery
- **Core functionality:** Essential for diagnosis feature
- **User benefit:** Allows using existing photos instead of taking new ones
- **Alternative to:** Legacy READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE (now deprecated)
- **Scoped access:** Only media files, not full storage access

**3. INTERNET Permission**

- **Why needed:** Send photos to our AI backend for analysis
- **Core functionality:** Required for all app features
- **User benefit:** Enables cloud-based AI diagnosis
- **Data transmission:** Encrypted via HTTPS

**4. RECORD_AUDIO Permission**

- **Why needed:** [If you don't use this, state you'll remove it]
- **Status:** Will be removed in next update if not needed
- [or justify if actually needed]

**5. VIBRATE Permission**

- **Why needed:** Haptic feedback for better UX
- **User benefit:** Tactile confirmation of button presses and actions
- **Non-essential:** App works without it

### Permissions NOT Requested

We specifically DO NOT request:

- ❌ Contacts (not relevant to our app)
- ❌ Phone/Call logs (only use phone number for auth)
- ❌ SMS (not needed)

### Privacy Policy Disclosure

All permissions are disclosed in our privacy policy:

- States we only access when explicitly using feature

### Updated Configuration

**AndroidManifest.xml:**

```xml
<!-- Camera for plant photos -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera" android:required="false"/>

<!-- Modern media access for Android 13+ -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_MEDIA_IMAGES"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_MEDIA_VIDEO"/>

<!-- Internet for AI analysis -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```
